AI Usage Declaration

After completing the assignment, I deployed the project on GitHub Pages. At that stage, I encountered an issue: the images in the assets folder were not loading on the deployed site, although they were visible locally. This resulted in 404 errors for all images.

Purpose of AI usage:

To understand why images were not loading on GitHub Pages.

To get guidance on the correct Git commands and steps to ensure the assets folder was properly tracked and uploaded.


AI was NOT used for:

Writing the core HTML or CSS for the assignment.

Structuring the layout, styling, or implementing any Figma design elements.


Reason for using AI:

I faced a technical deployment issue unrelated to the main coding task.

AI helped me quickly identify that the problem was due to Git tracking/caching of the assets folder and path issues, and suggested the proper steps to fix it.


After applying the AI-guided solution, all images loaded correctly on GitHub Pages.

I confirm that the main task (HTML + CSS coding from Figma design) was done entirely by me without dependency on AI.






Note: The assignment was completed within the 1-hour time limit. The timer was not visible on the screen recording due to oversight, but the coding and deployment process reflects the time constraint.
